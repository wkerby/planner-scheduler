# Planner-Scheduler

## Description

As part of the challenge 5 assignment I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The deployed application (link below in the usage section) features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript and the third party library Day.js, which is what I used to work with date and time.

## User Story

As part of this assignment, I was asked to make changes to a planner and scheduler that would allow users to save agenda items. The agenda items persists upon refresh. 

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance critetia below covers what I was asked to provide to the end user.

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Usage

The following animation (not my own) demonstrates the application functionality:
